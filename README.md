# Godzilla Flies

You begin life as a lonely fly, trying to avoid being eaten by predators. However, once you eat
some food, YOU become the predator. Your previous enemies will begin fleeing from your presence.
Continue consuming to continue evolving, but make sure to watch the time limit!


## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3 set up. Then, install the arcade module using:
